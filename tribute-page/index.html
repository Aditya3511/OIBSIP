            Dhoni made his debut for the Indian national cricket team in 2004 and went on to become one of

            major cricketing tournaments, including the ICC World T20 in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup
            in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Dhoni is also known for his finishing abilities,
            often taking the team to victory in tight situations with his aggressive batting style.
